    <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
            Hello My name is Hector, I'm a 41 years young Frontend Developer. I started learning web development in september 2024 by attending a course from JobLoop that is called "KodeHode".
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m currently attending a course at Jobloop to further expand my skills, and while I’m still learning, I’m eager to collaborate on projects or take on solo work related to design and development. I’m committed to putting in the hours needed to improve my coding abilities and create high-quality, impactful work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve worked on a variety of projects, ranging from simple HTML and CSS designs to more advanced applications built with JavaScript, React, and Vite. Recently, I’ve been diving into Vue to expand my skill set even further. My passion for frontend development comes from my love of design and the thrill of watching changes come to life in real time. There's something incredibly satisfying about transforming an idea into a functional, visually appealing experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding or watching tutorials, I’m busy being a proud father to two amazing kids – a boy and a girl. My little girl has even asked me to teach her how to code, as she shares my passion for creativity and loves to draw and make things just like I do. It’s exciting to see her take an interest in something I’m so passionate about!
